## [1.0.0] - 2023-11-16

### Added

- Add gunicorn support, expand config usage, fix docker image

### Feature

- Backend is now deployment ready using docker and fly.io

- Implement traits (#19)
- Implement creature types (#21)
- Implement multiple filter values (#23)
- Implement cache control (#25)
- Implement SQLite db (#28)

### Fixed

- Now get_bestiary returns json instead of string
- Handle difference between negative levels when calculating encounter info
- Next element wrong address
- Allow CORS calls
- Simplify calculate_encounter_difficulty, fix logical bug with trivial difficulty
- Populate new_ids_dict correctly (#7)
- Side effect on creature cache (#11)
- Refactor to handle correctly json body on post
- Use of scan instead of keys, that raised an error when the number of keys is high
- Creature_id endpoint overriding rarities, families, size, alignment etc
- Encounter info returning impossible on trivial encounters
- Pagination taking more element than requested
- Ln string not in caps
- Encounter info broken with negative enemies
- Set filtering was doing union operation instead of intersection
- Filter correctly vectors containing integer with value < -1
